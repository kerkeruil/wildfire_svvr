# Wildfire SVVR

## Overview
Wildfire SVVR is a visualization tool designed to simulate and visualize the spread of wildfires using various algorithms and data sources. This tool aims to help researchers understand and predict wildfire behavior.

## Usage
To start the simulation, run the following command:
```bash
pvpython create_animation.py
```

This will generate a folder that stores the visualization of each timestep in the selected wildfire dataset. Change the 
data_folder variable on the top of the file to point to where the data is located.
